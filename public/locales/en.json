I thought about completing it by strengthening the AuthGuard, implementing confirmation emails and phone numbers, refining post likes with algorithms, adding post filters, improving the overall design, enabling comment replies, incorporating notifications, friend lists, and other many, many features so it could be ready for production in a real-world scenario.
