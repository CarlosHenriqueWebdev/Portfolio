The project focused on a social website, featuring user registration, login, post creation, editing, deletion, likes, comments, user profiles, and profile editing. Additional features included an AuthGuard, user validation, and more. Regrettably, the project remained incomplete due to its nature as a online learning exercise. I thought about completing it by strengthening the AuthGuard, implementing confirmation emails and phone numbers, refining post likes with algorithms, adding post filters, improving the overall design, enabling comment replies, incorporating notifications, friend lists, and other many, many features so it could be ready for production in a real world scenario. However, the amount of work for creating a fully-fledged social media site completely alone felt like it would require a way too extreme amount of time invested on it, so I discarded the idea after doing it for a while.",
